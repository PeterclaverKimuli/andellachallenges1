This repository comprises my work in developing a web based application called Shopping list! The repository contains several folders and these include; UI, Design, CRUD and Wireframes. Each folder contains a file used to develop the application. 

The UI folder contains the HTML and CSS files used to develop the application, the design folder has the UML diagram for the application, the CRUD folder contains the the Python files used to 'Create', 'Read', 'Update' and 'Delete' features of the application and the Wireframes folder contains the files with the sketches of the application's design.
